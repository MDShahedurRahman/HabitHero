# NumberNinja

NumberNinja is a small Python command-line guessing game with difficulty levels, scoring, and unit tests.  
The goal is to guess a secret number within a limited number of attempts while receiving feedback to guide your guesses.

This project is intentionally lightweight and focuses on clean logic, testability, and proper GitHub workflow.
